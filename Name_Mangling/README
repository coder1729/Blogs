Make a function hi() in name_mangling.cpp , Compile it with a g++ compiler. Now function names have been mangled so if you try
to link another file and call hi() youll get an undefined symbol error. Now use nm to see the symbol table of the cpp file. You see
"hi" as "_Z2hiv" or *hi*. Put this in the C file and magically it works !
For the record gcc also name mangles cpp files, but the momemnt you name the same file to .c it stops name mangling
And doing nm gives
08048415 T hi
